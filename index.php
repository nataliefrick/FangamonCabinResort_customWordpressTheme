        <p><span class="big">FÅNGAMON LUXURY CABIN RESORT</span><br> is a slice of luxury in the robustness of the mountains. We have 10 cabins in different sizes to meet your needs, a main house where we offer breakfast and dinners. We also prepare take-away lunches on order. During your stay you are invited to join us for morning or evening yoga (or why not both), to start and end your day off right. During the day you can explore the area and activities provided by yourselves or book one of our guiding packages and we can lead the way.</p>
